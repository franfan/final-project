# final-project:Distance tracker
The final project is in order to track the distance with arduino, and using with leds and buzzer that can tell people how far is the distance.
# Summary
I am building a distance tracking equipment for this final project, when the distance is smaller than 10cm, the green led is lightning, and the buzzer will make some noise, if the distance is bigger than 10cm, then the yellow led is lighting. I think it's a great simple distance track for beginner to work with. And I think the project is a great beginner for alarms as well.
# Componet parts
I used with sr04, uno, leds, buzzer, male wires to create this project.
# Timeline
week0: write proposals
week1: figure out the wires, watch toturials
week2: figure out the codes, and rest of the things
week3: put all of them together
week4: present!
# Challenges
I think the project is easy to understand, but difficulte to put them together, and also there is something wierd going on that I can't figure out sometimes, and the toturials sometimes are not very easy to practice, I think I need some time to study deeper about coding and arduino.
# References and links
I download the code from "https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/31027/how-to-turn-a-led-if-ultranonic-hc-sr04-reading-is-on-defined-range-for-some-int" this cite, and based on the video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBmklx00HmA"
